ent test using 1Gib data sample
Entropy = 8.000000 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1073741824 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1073741824 samples is 245.52, and randomly
would exceed this value 65.38 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5034 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141479899 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000025 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
