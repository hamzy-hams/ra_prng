ent test using 1Gib data samples
Entropy = 8.000000 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1073741824 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1073741824 samples is 246.88, and randomly
would exceed this value 63.08 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5015 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141608980 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000059 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
